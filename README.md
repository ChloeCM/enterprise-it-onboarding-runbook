# Enterprise IT Onboarding & Access Runbook

This project documents how first-line IT support can safely onboard new employees in an enterprise environment.

The focus is on access verification, clear ownership, common onboarding failures, and when to escalate to second-line or application teams.

This is a process and documentation project, not a system configuration guide.
